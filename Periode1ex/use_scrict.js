//when we use "use strict" we tell the system it has to do what we exspect it to do, in this case i have not declared my variable, as var x
//but the problem is that the compiler can handle this problem, and will translate x to be hello, when we use "use scrict" it will tell us, that there are an error
// so "use scrict" let the program to run like the developer want it to. it prevent us to use specefik keywords, define a property more that ones ect.


y = "hello"
console.log(y)

"use strict"
// remove var y = ""
var y =""
y = "hello"
console.log(y)

var x = "hello"
console.log(x)
